## Description
This wargame is for the ones that want to learn basic exploitation. You can see the most common bugs in this game and we've tried to make them easy to exploit. You'll get the source code of each level to make it easier for you to spot the vuln and abuse it. The difficulty of the game is somewhere between Leviathan and Behemoth, but some of the levels could be quite tricky.

## The Challenge

The goal of this challenge was to find out who attacked your website.

The challenge came with a log file containing all the requests sent to your fictional website, including IPs and timestamps :

```bash
```

The list consisted of two attackers `37.139.17.15` and `192.241.254.77`.

The interesting one was `192.241.254.77` as it was the only IP that generated a `200` response from the `/admin` page.

<br>
Browsing to that IP reveals nothing but a plain text "go away" message :

    $ curl http://192.241.254.77/
    go away


<br>
A reverse lookup of the IP reveals `www.williestoleyour.pw` :

    $ nslookup 192.241.254.77
    Server:   10.10.10.10
    Address:  10.10.10.10#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    77.254.241.192.in-addr.arpa name = www.williestoleyour.pw.

    Authoritative answers can be found from:
    . nameserver = d.root-servers.net.
    . nameserver = e.root-servers.net.
    . nameserver = i.root-servers.net.
    [ ... ]

<br>
<br>
Not much to go on here, nothing in the source code and searches through [dnsdumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/) and [w3dt](https://w3dt.net/tools/dnsrecon) didn't reveal much.

The contact section had the following email : `info@williestoleyour.pw`

A search through the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) reveals the same website with a different email `info@dynamiclock.pw`:
